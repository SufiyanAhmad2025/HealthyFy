      <h2>Exercise Boosts Mental Health</h2>
      <h4>
        Regular exercise increases the release of endorphins, which are natural mood lifters. <br>
        It helps reduce stress, anxiety, and depression levels. <br>
        Even 30 minutes of daily physical activity can significantly improve your mental well-being. <br>
        Working out also improves focus, memory, and cognitive performance. <br>
        A healthy body often leads to a healthier and happier mind.
      </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="two">
      <h2>Nutrition is the Foundation of Fitness</h2>
      <h4>
        A balanced diet fuels your workouts and helps your body recover faster. <br>
        Proper nutrition supports muscle growth, fat loss, and overall energy levels. <br>
        Skipping meals can reduce performance and increase fatigue. <br>
        Hydration is equally important for maintaining stamina. <br>
        Remember: what you eat directly impacts how you perform.
      </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="three">
      <h2>Rest and Recovery are Essential</h2>
      <h4>
        Muscles don’t grow during workouts, they grow while resting. <br>
        Sleep helps repair tissues, restore energy, and balance hormones. <br>
        Overtraining without recovery can lead to injuries. <br>
        Aim for at least 7–8 hours of quality sleep daily. <br>
        Balance is the key to sustainable progress.
      </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="four">
      <h2>Knowledge is Power</h2>
      <h4>
        Knowledge is the light that removes the darkness of ignorance. <br>
        The more you learn, the more you grow. <br>
        Wisdom begins where knowledge ends. <br>
        Knowledge shared is knowledge multiplied. <br>
        Every day is a chance to learn something new.
      </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="five">
      <h2>Consistency Beats Intensity</h2>
      <h4>
        Small efforts done consistently bring greater results than short bursts of intensity. <br>
        Regular habits shape long-term success. <br>
        Missing workouts often breaks momentum. <br>
        Consistency builds discipline and discipline builds results. <br>
        Progress is the sum of small actions done daily.
      </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="six">
      <h2>Strength Training Boosts Metabolism</h2>
      <h4>
        Lifting weights builds lean muscle mass that burns calories even at rest. <br>
        A stronger body means better posture and reduced risk of injuries. <br>
        It helps regulate blood sugar and improves bone density. <br>
        Both men and women benefit equally from strength training. <br>
        It’s not about lifting heavy, it’s about lifting smart.
      </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="seven">
      <h2>Knowledge and Action</h2>
      <h4>
        Knowledge without action is like a book never read. <br>
        Curiosity is the fuel for knowledge. <br>
        An investment in knowledge pays the best interest. <br>
        Learning never exhausts the mind. <br>
        True wisdom is applying what you know.
      </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="eight">
      <h2>Cardio Improves Heart Health</h2>
      <h4>
        Cardio exercises strengthen the heart and improve blood circulation. <br>
        Activities like running, cycling, or swimming boost endurance. <br>
        Cardio helps in weight management by burning calories. <br>
        It also reduces the risk of chronic diseases. <br>
        Just 20–30 minutes of cardio a day can make a big difference.
